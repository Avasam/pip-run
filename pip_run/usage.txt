Arguments to pip-run prior to `--` are used to specify the requirements
to make available, just as arguments to pip install. For example:

	pip-run -r requirements.txt "requests>=2.0"

That will launch python after installing the deps in requirements.txt
and also a late requests. Packages are always installed to a temporary
location and cleaned up when the process exits.  The argument
`--ipython` may also be included, in which case an IPython interpreter
will be started in interactive mode instead of a Python interpreter.  This
is for convenience, and is equivalent to:

	pip-run ipython -- -m IPython

If there exist any arguments succeeding a ``--``, the argument is equivalent
specifying IPython as a pip dependency.  Arguments after `--` are passed to
the Python interpreter. So to launch `script.py`:

	pip-run -- script.py

For simplicity, the `--` may be omitted and Python arguments will
be inferred starting with the first Python file that exists:

	pip-run script.py

If the `--` is omitted or nothing is passed, the python interpreter
will be launched in interactive mode:

	pip-run
